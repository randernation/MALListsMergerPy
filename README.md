# MALListsMergerPy
Implementation of https://github.com/m4st3rP/MyAnimeListUserListsMerger in python 2.7.

Usage instructions:
Copy text dump from http://affinity.animesos.net/ into first window. Submit will run the program and print back the results in the second window. Export will save the results to a file. Optionally, a username can also be specified. If one is, all previously seen entries are ignored.

Algorithmically, MALListsMergerPy one borrows as closely as possible from the original, and should be functionally the same. MALListsMergerPy does not count shows that have not been rated.
